# Hi, I'm Mitchell Daneker

I'm a graduate student and researcher passionate about leveraging machine learning, data science, and bioengineering to tackle complex biological challenges. My research focuses on cutting-edge areas such as **Genetically Encoded Voltage Indicators (GEVIs)**, **protein engineering**, and **modeling and simulation in biopharmaceutical processes**.

On this GitHub, you'll find projects, code, and publications showcasing my experience in **machine-learning-guided protein design**, **machine learning for solving ODEs/PDEs**, and **advanced data analytics**. I'm particularly interested in combining computational techniques with biological research to drive innovation in healthcare and biotechnology.
